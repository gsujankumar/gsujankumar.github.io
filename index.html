<h2>About Me</h2>
</header>

<p>I am currently with Amazon as a Research Scientist.</p>

<p>Prior to joining Amazon, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I was advised by Prof. Naresh Shanbhag. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, with a bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree in Electrical Engineering. My master&#39;s thesis was on optical phase-locked loops.</p>

<h3>Research Overview</h3>

<section>
<p>My research broadly spans integrated circuit design and machine learning (ML). Specifically, I am interested in problems that require the implementation of ML on resource-constrained platforms. If you are interested in my research further check out <a href="publications.html">my publications</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-memory-Architectures-Machine-Learning/dp/3030359700/ref=sr_1_1?">this book</a> that I co-authored.</p>


<p>Here are few of my recent projects:</p>

<h4>Deep In-Memory Computing Architectures for Machine Learning</h4>

<p>This project tackles the problem of high energy and latency costs of data movement between processor and memory. We propose deep in-memory architecture (DIMA) that tackles this problem by embedded computations into the memory arrays. DIMA drastically reduces memory read and data access costs by performing mixed-signal computations in the periphery of the memory array. We estimated that a DIMA-based architecture to accelerate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that shows over 5 and 2.4 times simultaneous improvements in energy-efficiency and throughput. We demonstrated the DIMA concept by designed a multi-functional SRAM-based DIMA IC on 65 nm CMOS that can be reconfigured to implement multiple machine learning algorithms such as SVM, DNN, and k-NN while showing 10x energy savings and 5x throughput enhancement.</p>

<h4>Application-Specific ML accelerators using In-Memory Architectures</h4>


<p>In this project, we focus on designing ML accelerators for some very popular ML algorithms for the edge.  Designed the world&#39;s first dedicated IC for random forest algorithm using DIMA on 65 nm CMOS showing 6.8x improvement in energy-delay product. <br />
<br />
We also designed a dedicated key-word spotting IC that achieves state-of-the-art decision latency of 40us with decision energy &lt;0.5uJ/decision which translates to more than 24 times savings in the energy-delay product (EDP) of decisions over existing KWS ICs. This IC is ideal for products that have key-word triggered functionalities such as Amazon Alexa.</p>


<h4>Variation-tolerant machine learning classifier via on-chip training </h4>


<p>A major challenge in ICs that rely on analog computations such as DIMA, is its sensitivity to process variations. We studied the use of on-chip learning to achieve variation-tolerance in mixed-signal machine learning architectures. We designed a DIMA based classifier IC with an on-chip SGD based trainer on 65 nm CMOS which adapts to changing environment and process parameters. It demonstrates 2.4x energy reduction over previous ICs.</p>



<h4>Machine learning acceleration using Beyond-CMOS devices</h4>

<p>With CMOS scaling slowing down, new process technologies are needed to keep up with the demand for increased computing power. I worked on a broad spectrum of projects to address the challenges in realize ML accelerators using beyond CMOS devices: 1)  I designed a NAND flash-based DIMA for large-scale machine learning acceleration showing an 8x reduction in energy consumption. 2) I worked an ML accelerator using MRAM devices that achieve 4.5x and 70x lower energy and delay than their CMOS counterparts. I worked on an algorithm that achieves high-accuracy writes for RRAM crossbar-based machine learning accelerators at 5x-to-10x lower cost than standard program-verify methods.</p>
